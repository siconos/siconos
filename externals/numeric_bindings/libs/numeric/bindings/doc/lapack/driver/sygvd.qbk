[section sygvd]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sygvd` available, please see below.
``
sygvd( const int_t itype, const char jobz, MatrixA& a,
        MatrixB& b, VectorW& w );
``


[heading Description]

`sygvd` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSYGVD and DSYGVD. 
`sygvd` computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x, A*Bx=(lambda)*x, or B*A*x=(lambda)*x. Here A and
B are assumed to be symmetric and B is also positive definite.
If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/sygvd.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::sygvd( x, y, z );

``

this will output
