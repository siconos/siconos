# siconos configuration file.
# See http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/git-master/manual/cmake-packages.7.html#creating-packages
# 
# This file have been generated during siconos install and
# may be used by another cmake project to retrieve all the configuration variables
# of siconos.
#
#
# Usage :
# 
# find_package(siconos)
# include_directories(${siconos_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
# # ... define some target ...
# target_link_libraries(my_target ${siconos_LIBRARIES})
#
# A call to find_package(siconos) 
# will set the following variables :
#
# siconos_INCLUDE_DIR = where to find siconos headers
# siconos_INCLUDE_DIRS : The final set of include directories listed in one variable for use by client code. It includes both path to siconos headers and path to external libraries headers
# siconos_LIBRARIES : the libraries to link against to use siconos
# siconos_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES : the libraries on which siconos libs depend.
# siconos_ROOT_DIR : where to find the base directory of siconos
# siconos_FOUND : true if the find process went fine
# 
# 
# Note : var names chosen as recommended here :
# http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-developer.7.html#manual:cmake-developer(7))
