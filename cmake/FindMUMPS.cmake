# Find MUMPS libraries and headers
#
# Usage :
# 
# find_package(MUMPS REQUIRED)
# target_link_libraries(yourlib PRIVATE MUMPS::MUMPS)
#
# It will handles both linking and include directories for your target.
#
# This module sets the following variables:
#
# MUMPS_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the MUMPS interface
#    is found
# MUMPS_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to
#    link against to use MUMPS
# MUMPS_INCLUDE_DIR - location of mumps headers found by cmake

# Set MUMPS_DIR=<where mumps is installed> if it's not in a "classic" place or if you want a specific version
