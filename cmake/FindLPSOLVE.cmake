Find lpsolve libraries and headers

Usage :
 
find_package(LPSOLVE REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(yourlib PRIVATE LPSOLVE::LPSOLVE)

Set LPSOLVE_ROOT=<where lpsolve is installed>
if it's not in a "classic" place or if you want a specific version

Header : lp_lib.h
Lib : <prefix>lpsolve55.<suffix>

#]=======================================================================]

include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)

if(NOT LPSOLVE_ROOT)
  set(LPSOLVE_ROOT $ENV{LPSOLVE_ROOT})
endif()

# Try to help find_package process (pkg-config ...)
set_find_package_hints(NAME LPSOLVE MODULE lpsolve)

find_path(LPSOLVE_INCLUDE_DIR NAMES lp_lib.h
  PATH_SUFFIXES lpsolve include
  ${_LPSOLVE_INC_SEARCH_OPTS}
  )

if(NOT LPSOLVE_LIBRARIES)
  # Fix debian nonsense:
  # see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=503314
  if(EXISTS "/etc/debian_version")
    find_library(LPSOLVE_LIBRARIES NAMES liblpsolve55.so
      ${_LPSOLVE_SEARCH_OPTS}
      PATH_SUFFIXES lib/lp_solve lib)
  else()
    find_library(LPSOLVE_LIBRARIES NAMES lpsolve55
      ${_LPSOLVE_SEARCH_OPTS}
      PATH_SUFFIXES lib lib64)
  endif()
endif()
