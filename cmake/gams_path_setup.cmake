What is done in this file ?

* if GAMS_ROOT is set, checks for gams (http://www.gams.com) in GAMS_ROOT directory
   -> list gams source files and add them to numerics build
   -> install gams models files 
    
* Look for Path Ferris solver (optional hint : PathFerris_ROOT),
if found, link numerics with Path Ferris.

* Look for Path VI solver (optional hint : PathVI_ROOT),
if found, link numerics with Path Ferris.


Remarks :

* PathVI and PathFerris are only used (libs and headers) at build time
(through PRIVATE option of target_link_libraries).
Note FP : maybe we should propagate them at runtime ?
(if so path headers from externals must be installed)

* Path headers are distributed in Siconos in externals component.

* If GAMS is setup and found, and if PathFerris/VI_ROOT are not set, GAMS_ROOT is used as a hint to find Path headers.




Example of usage :


cmake -DGAMS_ROOT=<path-to-gams-install> -DPathVI_ROOT=... -DPathFerris_ROOT=...
