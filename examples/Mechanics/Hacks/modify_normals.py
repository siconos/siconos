# Example of overriding BulletR to modify the contact normals.
#
# The idea here is to add some random noise to the contact normals,
# simulating an object bounding on rough ground without having to
# incur the cost of actually simulating the geometry of rough ground.
#
# We override the BulletR class's updateContactPoints method to
# achieve this.  In order to instantiate our own BulletR class, we
# also have to provide a makeBulletR function for our override of the
# SiconosBulletCollisionManager.
