 * \brief non-public functions and data structures for CSparseMatrix
 *
 * Include this file from .c/.cpp files if there is a need to access
 * members of CSparseMatrix (treat it as non-opaque type) or call
 * CXSparse functions.
 *
 * To use the correct cs_* functions, privately define CS_LONG
 * according to SICONOS_INT64. User code must do the same, but we do
 * not impose on user code independently using CXSparse by defining
 * CS_LONG in our external headers. Nonetheless CSparseMatrix is
 * typedef'd according to SICONOS_INT64 in SparseMatrix.h, therefore
 * it should throw a type error if there is a mismatch.
