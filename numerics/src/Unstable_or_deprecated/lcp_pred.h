     - Then it tries to find z by assuming that the indices of the non-zero elements
     are the same as the previous solution (previous solutions with trivial case of q positive excepted of course).\n
     - If q is not positive and prediction failed, the regular LCP solver is called.\n

   *  in block iteration are stored as well as the corresponding submatrix Mi~ of this diagonal block. \n
   *  Thus Mi~ * zi_k~ = -qi_k~. The solver tries first to solve the new sub-LCP (Mi,qi_k+1) \n
   *  by solving the linear system Mi~ * zi_k+1~ = -qi_k+1~. If this does not work, the regular LCP algorithm is called.\n
   *  - "vec" means that a set of LCP solver methods is provided, and applied individually to the corresponding diagonal sub-LCP.\n
   *  If there are less solvers than diagonal blocks, the last solver is applied to all last diagonal blocks.\n

   * \param q        On enter, the vector of doubles of the LCP
   * \param ptvec       On enter, a pointer on the list of solving methods
   *
   * \param z        On enter/return, a vector of doubles which contains the initial iterate for the LCP(q,M) and returns the solution of the problem.

   * \param it_end   On return, an integer which returns the final number of block iterations
   * \param itt_end  On return, an integer which returns the total number of local LCP iterations or pivots
