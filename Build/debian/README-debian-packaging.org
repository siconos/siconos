#+TITLE: Packaging Siconos for Debian

This document details how to generate Siconos .deb packages in a
Debian Sid container.  This should be done whenever a new version of
Siconos is released.  All steps should be followed in order.

* Clone and set up siconos-deb

Check out the repository siconos-deb.git.  It is a fork of siconos.git
that has a branch called debian/sid.

Ensure your checkout of siconos-deb has the 'upstream' remote set to
http://github.com/siconos/siconos.  The 'origin' remote should be set
to git@github.com:siconos/siconos-deb, and there should be a local
branch 'debian/sid' tracking 'origin/debian/sid':

  : git remote add upstream http://github.com/siconos/siconos
  : git remote update
  : git branch -D master
  : git checkout -b upstream origin/master
  : git checkout -b debian/sid origin/debian/sid

* Export GPG keys

To sign packages, the container needs your gpg signing keys.
If you do not have a signing key, see instructions here:

https://keyring.debian.org/creating-key.html

You must export your keys to a file "gpg-secrets" before running docker build:

  : cd ~/projects/siconos/Build/debian
  : gpg --export -a -o gpg-secrets
  : gpg --export-secret-keys -a -o - | cat >>gpg-secrets

We cannot do "gpg --import" during "docker build" because it is unable
to ask for the passphrase, so instead it is ADDed to the container we
will do the import later during "docker run", below.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to delete it after all this is over, both the
original and the version copied to the image!  Do not push your Docker
image to the cloud!

* Build the Docker container

Set up a clean Docker container based on Debian unstable (sid), using
the Dockerfile found in Build/debian:

  : cd ~/projects/siconos/Build/debian
  : docker build -t sid-package .

It has git and packaging tools already installed.  The rest should be
installed during package building by the package build dependencies.
Leaving all other packages uninstalled by default should help make
sure dependencies are complete.

Run it with a volume allowing access to the siconos-deb work dir and gpg-secrets:

  : cd ~/projects/siconos-deb
  : docker run -it -v $PWD:/root/siconos-deb sid-package

* Import GPG secrets

From within the container, we now need to import the secret signing key.

  : root@c565375d37b8:~# gpg --import gpg-secrets
  : root@c565375d37b8:~# rm gpg-secrets

and enter the passphrase when prompted.

* Install build dependencies

Next, to install the build dependencies, here is the trick:

  : root@c565375d37b8:/# cd ~/siconos-deb
  : root@c565375d37b8:~/siconos-deb# mk-build-deps -i

This will produce a .deb file with the dependencies listed in
debian/rules, and attempt to install it, which will fail!  Then delete
it and use apt-get to resolve the dependencies:

  : root@c565375d37b8:~/siconos-deb# rm siconos-build-deps_4.0.0-1_all.deb
  : root@c565375d37b8:~/siconos-deb# apt-get -y -f install

* Build the packages

Now building the packages should succeed.  We use "gbp" tools,
i.e. "git buildpackage" to manage this:

  : root@c565375d37b8:~/siconos-deb# gbp buildpackage --git-pristine-tar \
  :   --git-pristine-tar-commit --git-upstream-tag='%(version)s' \
  :   --git-debian-branch=debian/sid

Relevant instructions to using gbp for this project can be found at:

http://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.import.html

starting at the section entitled, "When upstream uses Git", and the
specific case "No upstream tarballs".  However, the following are some
basic notes for how to update the package for a new version of Siconos.

Now, fetch the latest from siconos:

  : root@c565375d37b8:~/siconos-deb# git fetch upstream

Say that debian/sid currently points to the tag 4.0.0, but the fetch
told us that a new tag 4.1.0 now exists and we want to do a new
package for it.  Checkout debian/sid (make sure it is up to date with
origin/debian/sid, not shown here) and merge in 4.1.0:

  : root@c565375d37b8:~/siconos-deb# git checkout debian/sid
  : root@c565375d37b8:~/siconos-deb# git merge 4.1.0

Check if anything needs to be changed in the debian/*.install files,
e.g. if there are new tools, and debian/control if there are new
dependencies.

Finally, update the changelog using "gbp dch" and re-build the package
with "gbp buildpackage" as instructed above.

  : root@c565375d37b8:~/siconos-deb# gbp dch --debian-branch=debian/sid --snapshot --auto debian/

You can add the argument,

  : --git-ignore-new

to gdb buildpackage if you are working on the package and haven't
committed changes yet, otherwise it will complain about changes to the
git repository.  When done, update the changelog to "release", commit,
and build the final package:

  : gbp dch --release --auto --git-debian-branch=debian/sid
  : git commit -m"Release 4.1.0" debian/changelog
  : gbp buildpackage --git-upstream-tag='%(version)s' --git-debian-branch=debian/sid
