This file is a brain dump for cross compiling from Linux to windows

## Toolchain

It is recommended to use the mxe environment : http://mxe.cc/ https://github.com/mxe/mxe

Then you have to install the dependencies :
make gcc boost gmp cppunit blas cblas lapack pthreads # to complete

You may need to switch to the master branch since some fixes were needed.
They are now upstream but they still have to land on the stable branch.

No python :(

= Python

/!\ This is really hackisch
* get the python installer (python-*.msi)
* create a dir and cd into it
* uncompress it using cabextract : cabextract python-*.msi

To get numpy
* download the exe
* create a dir
* unzip it with unzip : unzip numpy*.exe

You need swig on the host machine (and also numpy)

To run the Python tests, you need to install 
* Python: wine msiexec /i python-*.msi
* Numpy: wine numpy*.exe
* pytest:
    * first get setuptools*.exe, install it ( wine setuptools*.exe )
    * Add to the windows Path the following directories: C:\Python27 C:\Python27\Scripts
    wine cmd 
    REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v Path /d "%PATH%;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts" /f
    * Pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html#using-the-installer
    curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
    wine python.exe get-pip.py
    * Pytest : wine pip.exe install -U pytest

You should be all set.

## Sample command to build Siconos:

You can also have a look at build-short-vc.sh in the Build/crossCompilation directory.

## BUGS
* Sometimes to share a value between the example program and a plugin DLL,
the plugin DLL is compiled with an undefined reference, that is resolved when
it is loaded into the example. Unfortunately, i686-pc-mingw32-ld seems to be unable
to create a DLL with undefined reference. Then some examples cannot work.
* There seems to be a numerical precision issue with builds using mingw32.

## TODO
* Polish the Front-End cross-compilation
* Fix bugs !
* create an installer (nsis is available from mxe and works fine with cpack)
* Make examples work !
* Try to compile it natively on windows ( using mingw or Codeblocks or cygwin or ...)

## TIPS
* Use Dependency Walker to see dlls used by a dll
