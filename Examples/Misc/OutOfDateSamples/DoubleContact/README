DoubleContact sample :

This sample has been made to test multiple contacts between dynamical systems.
There are 3 points of which 1 is static, and the 2 others are moving.
All the movement are only on 1 axis!
The 3 points are aligned. The 2 points that are moving are converging, and the convergence point correponds to the place of the third point.
Interactions are defined between points 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 1 and 3.
So we have one contact point where the 3 interactions are activated.
