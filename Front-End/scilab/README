Introduction
-------------

The directory scilab/ contains a prototype of siconos interface with
scilab. It allows a 'high-level' interaction with the siconos platform
with around 20 scilab functions. It allows flat acces without having
deep siconos tree acces like proposed with python interface.

This interface consists in :
 
 siconos.cpp : a C++ module with global objects (Model and Simulation)
 and "C" functions which uses it.

 siconos.sci : interface "C" functions of siconos.cpp in scilab
function. It uses the simplest mechanism : scilab link and scilab
call.

Scilab function implemented:
 sicLink()  // Load siconos platform
 sicLoadModel(ModelXml) // Load a Xml model
 sicTimeGetH()
 sicTimeGetK()
 sicTimeGetN()
 sicInitSimulation()
 sicSTNextStep()
 sicSTComputeFreeState()
 sicSTcomputePb()
 sicSTupdateState()
 sicModelgetQ(index)


BouncingBall Execution
-----------------------
variables of environnement to set (example):

export SICONOSPATH=/local_home/pissard/Workspace/siconos/distrib
export NUMERICSPATH=/local_home/pissard/Workspace/siconos/distrib

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SICONOSPATH/lib:$SICONOSPATH/share/siconos-kernel:$NUMERICSPATH/lib:.

copy the xml file (BouncingBall_TIDS.xml) in the current directory
copy BallPlugin.so in $SICONOSPATH/share/siconos-kernel

scilab -f sample.sci : scilab example of the "famous" BouncingBall execution

scilab> BouncingBall();

normally, you will see during the simulation the ball animation; and
after the simulation the plot of y(t)

Limitations 
----------- 

The goal of this prototype is to validate and illustrate the scilab
interface mechanism. We implement only scilab function required to
bouncing ball simulation.

TODO by RPG
------------
It remains some work to validate scilab mechanism:
 - use a scilab function for a siconos simulation like a 'C' plugin
 - solve the bug with DGETRI call (on parameter 6) which has been fixed with a
simple silab catch error !



TODO for a complete toolbox
----------------------------
 - robustify the prototype (test pointers values before calling, test if some requiered functions have been called before others,...)
 - doxygen code documentation
 - complete scilab function like (non exhaustive)
  sicModelgetVelocity
  sicModelgetLambda
  sicModel(all parameters)
  sicInteractionDisplay
  sicModelSaveXMLfile
  sicIsModelComplete
  sicCreateModel
  all setters
  sicDSgetNumber
  and so on...

 - is it necessary to use a global object to encapsulate the use of
siconos objects ?

 - scilab 'C' Gateway to replace call ?

 - Packaging toolbox (compilation, loading and documentation)
