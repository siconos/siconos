----+ Little help to install the platform (Numerics, Kernel, Front-End):

---++ Required external libraries

   * libxml2
      * actual version used with the platform : 2.6.17
      * last version : 2.6.17 
      * known problems : none
      * location : http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html

   * lapack++
      * actual version used with the platform: 2.1.2
      * last version : 2.1.2
      * known problems : with version 2.1.0, the platform crashs during the linking => fixed in 2.1.2
      * location : http://sourceforge.net/projects/lapackpp

   * nana
      * actual version used with the platform: 2.5
      * last version : 2.5
      * known problems : compilation problems
      * location : Gforge

   * cppunit
      * actual version used with the platform: 1.10.2
      * last version : 1.10.2
      * known problems : none
      * location : http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi


---++ Getting the sources

   * Through the svn server (acess required)
       svn checkout svn+ssh://dveloppeur@scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/siconos
       for more explanation see http://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=9
   * Download the source packages on the Gforge   


---++ Numerics installation

   * Change directory to your source directory <br>
   =% cd /path/to/your/source/code/=

---+++ Creation of the configure script and run it

On SVN server, the platform is distributed in a developer version. To get a version "ready-to-install", autotools need to be configured. The script reconf.sh do this operation. It creates the script configure and Makefiles of the platform.

   * Run bash script reconf.sh
   <br>
   =% ./reconf.sh=

   * Run configure script 
   <br>
   =% ./configure --prefix="the path where you want to install the platform"= 

   * If you have a local installation of an external library, you can give its path to configure with the option --with-local[library name]. You can get the possible options typing =%configure --help=. 

   * =% ./configure --help provides you with the others options

---+++ Compilation and installation of the Kernel

   * Compilation of the platform : <br>
   =% make=

   * Installation of the platform : <br>
   =% make install= (as root of neccesary)

      
---+++ Is the installation of the Kernel OK ?
   =% make check

 

---++ Kernel installation (for developers)
   
   * Change directory to your source directory <br>
   =% cd /path/to/your/source/code/Kernel=

   * The same standard procedure as in Kernel : <br>
   =% ./reconf.sh= <br>
   =% ./configure --prefix="the path where you want to install the platform"=  <br>
   =% make= <br>
   =% make install= (as root if necessary) <br>



      
---+++ Is the installation of the Kernel OK ?
   * You can try to run : cd /path/to/your/source/code/sample/BouncingBall ; siconos BouncingBall.cpp

---+++ Compilation and installation of the Front-End

   * Change directory to your source directory <br>
   =% cd /path/to/your/source/code/Front-End=

---+++ Creation of the configure script and run it

   * Run bash script reconf.sh
   <br>
   =% ./reconf.sh=

   * Run configure script 
   <br>
   =% ./configure --prefix="the path where you want to install the platform"= 

   * *I advise you for the moment to install the platform in the directory retrieved from SVN. C++ compiler, System libraries, external libraries, etc. are tested...

   * If you have a local installation of an external library, you can give its path to configure with the option --with-local[library name]. You can get the possible options typing =%configure --help=. 

   * =% ./configure --help provides you with the others options

---+++ Compilation and installation of the Kernel


   * Compilation of the Front-End : <br>
   =% make=

   * Installation of the Front-End : <br>
   =% make install= (as root of neccesary)

---+++ Is the installation of the Font-End OK ?
   * You can try to run : cd /path/to/your/source/code/sample/BouncingBall ; pySiconos BouncingBall.py
