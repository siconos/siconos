[section heevr]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `heevr` available, please see below.
``
heevr( const char jobz, const char range, MatrixA& a, const Scalar >,
        const Scalar >, const int_t il,
        const int_t iu, const Scalar >, int_t& m,
        VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z, VectorISUPPZ& isuppz );

[heading Description]

`heevr` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSYEVR, DSYEVR, CHEEVR, and ZHEEVR. 
`heevr` computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a complex Hermitian matrix A. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
indices for the desired eigenvalues.

`heevr` first reduces the matrix A to tridiagonal form T with a call
to ZHETRD. Then, whenever possible, `heevr` calls ZSTEMR to compute
eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations. ZSTEMR
computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
(also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.

For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
(a) Compute T - sigma I = L D L^T, so that L and D
define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
(b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
(c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
(d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.

The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
parameter ABSTOL.

Note 1 : `heevr` calls ZSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
`heevr` calls DSTEBZ and ZSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
when partial spectrum requests are made.

Normal execution of ZSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
manner.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.
