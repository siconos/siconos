--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 How to load and install Numerics:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---++ Required external libraries

   * atlas

---++ Optional external libraries

   * cppunit
      * actual version used with the platform: 1.10.2
      * last version : 1.10.2
      * known problems : none
      * location : http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi

---++ Getting the sources

   * Through the svn server (acess required)
       svn checkout svn+ssh://user@scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/siconos
       for more explanation see http://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=9

   * Download the source packages on the Gforge   

---++ INSTALL 

in Numerics directory:
	
	- ./autogen.sh
	- ./configure --prefix="the path where you want to install the platform" --other_options
	- make
	- make install (default install location: /usr/local) 

for more details on configure options, type configure --help. 

To run tests : make check

To generate doc: make doc or launch doxywizard, load config/DoxygenNumerics.cfg and "start".
Generated html or latex files are in ../Docs/htdocs/DoxygenNumerics. 
      
   * If you have a local installation of an external library, you can give its path to configure with the option --with-[library name]. You can get the possible options typing = ./configure --help. 

INSTALLATION ON MACOSX

One Mach-O feature that hits many people by surprise is the strict distinction between shared libraries and dynamically loadable modules. On ELF systems both are the same; any piece of shared code can be used as a library and for dynamic loading. Use otool -hv some_file to see the filetype of some_file.

Mach-O shared libraries have the file type MH_DYLIB and carry the extension .dylib. They can be linked against with the usual static linker flags, e.g. -lfoo for libfoo.dylib. However, they can not be loaded as a module. (Side note: Shared libraries can be loaded dynamically through an API. However, that API is different from the API for bundles and the semantics make it useless for an dlopen() emulation. Most notably, shared libraries can not be unloaded.)

Loadable modules are called "bundles" in Mach-O speak. They have the file type MH_BUNDLE. Since no component involved cares about it, they can carry any extension. The extension .bundle is recommended by Apple, but most ported software uses .so for the sake of compatibility. Bundles can be dynamically loaded and unloaded via dyld APIs, and there is a wrapper that emulates dlopen() on top of that API. It is not possible to link against bundles as if they were shared libraries. However, it is possible that a bundle is linked against real shared libraries; those will be loaded automatically when the bundle is loaded.

Note : To obtain a module you have just to add -module option to linker flag for libtool. For Siconos Numerics :

libSiconosNumerics_la_LDFLAGS= -version-info $(SICONOSNUMERICS_SO_CURRENT):$(SICONOSNUMERICS_SO_REVISION):$(SICONOSNUMERICS_SO_AGE) -module


For the Siconos Numerics, we have chosen to build a shared library (.dylib) and not a module, because you can not link a module. A way to link with a module is to create a dummy .cpp file wich load the module !!!

To obtain a shared libray,  you have just to add -dynamiclib option to linker flag for libtool. For Siconos Numerics :

libSiconosNumerics_la_LDFLAGS= -version-info $(SICONOSNUMERICS_SO_CURRENT):$(SICONOSNUMERICS_SO_REVISION):$(SICONOSNUMERICS_SO_AGE) -dynamiclib

Note that this is the default option.


Unfortunatly, COMMON fortran bloc in odepack precludes to obtain a right building. We need to add the -single_module option. This option is only activate for the LIBTOOL tag CXX and not for CC, i.e. it works for
/bin/sh ../libtool --tag=CXX --mode=link gcc  -Wall -fPIC   -o libSiconosNumerics.la -rpath /usr/local/lib -version-info 1:2:0  ../src/odepack/libodepack.la ../src/NSSpack/libNSSpack.la 
and not for
/bin/sh ../libtool --tag=CC --mode=link gcc  -Wall -fPIC   -o libSiconosNumerics.la -rpath /usr/local/lib -version-info 1:2:0  ../src/odepack/libodepack.la ../src/NSSpack/libNSSpack.la 

To overcome ths difficulty I force tha TAG og libtool to CXX thanks to a dummy.cpp file  


We are seeking for a proper solution !!! 

Perhaps it is possible to have both but i do not know exactly how for the moment. 

Some Troubles with libtool cab arised. We try to fix it for the moment.
