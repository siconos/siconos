Notes:

Changes:
2006-02-15   Vincent Acary <vincent.acary@inrialpes.fr>

	* /macros/ac_f77_library_ldflags.m4 : This file is added and 
	replaced the system defined macro. A small correction is done 
	to neglect -lcrt2.o option at linking on MacOsX. This bug will 
	be normally corrected in further version of autoconf.

2006-02-13   Vincent Acary <vincent.acary@inrialpes.fr>

	* /src/NSSpack/test/Makefile.am 
	Use of the variable XFAIL_TESTS for tests expected failures

2006-02-10   Franck Perignon <franck.perignon@inrialpes.fr> 
	     Vincent Acary <vincent.acary@inrialpes.fr>

        * Update macros m4 for cppunit => the same as in kernel
	  (this to correct install bug 494)
	  Minor changes in configure.ac, (--with-name rather than
	  --with-local-name)
	* Update obsolete keywords in Doxygen config file
	* Changes in headers files for odepack: add usefull functions
	  for Lsodar solver in Kernel.

  v1.1.0 - February 2006 (release 385)

Notes:

Changes:

2006-01-31   Franck Perignon <franck.perignon@inrialpes.fr> 
	     Vincent Acary <vincent.acary@inrialpes.fr>

        * rename reconf.sh in autogen.sh and m4 directory in macros
	  Use standard acx_blas and lapack macros. 
	  Warning: new options for configure ( -> configure --help for details )
	

2006-01-20   Vincent Acary <vincent.acary@inrialpes.fr>

        * configure.ac, src/utils/blaslapack.h, f2c.h: Add workaround for 
	gcc-4.0.2 gfortran-4.0.2 and so on. Use of a local f2c.h for gcc4.
	use of the macro AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS for linking gcc and gfortran 
	compiled codes
