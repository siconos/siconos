Linear Complementarity problems (LCP)
=====================================

.. _lc_problem_1lcpIntro:
.. rubric:: The problem:

The Linear Complementarity problem (LCP) is defined by

Find :math:`(z,w)` such that:

.. math::

    \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} M \ z + q = w \\ 0 \le w \perp z \ge 0 \end{cases}, \end{equation*}

where :math:` w, z, q` are vectors of size :math:`n` and :math:` M ` is a :math:`n\times n` matrix.

The notation :math:`x \perp y` means that :math:`x^Ty =0` . Inequalities involving vectors are understood to hold component-wise.

From more details on theory and analysis of LCP, we refer to

R.W. Cottle, J.S. Pang, and R.E. Stone. *The Linear Complementarity Problem.* Academic Press, Inc., Boston, MA, 1992.

The problem is stored and given to the solver in numerics thanks to the C structure :ref:`LinearComplementarityProblem <struct_linear_complementarity_problem>` .
