Siconos is an open-source scientific software package for modelling and simulation of nonsmooth dynamical systems in C++ and Python.

Our main applications are mechanical systems (rigid or solid) with unilateral contact and Coulomb friction and impact (nonsmooth mechanics, contact dynamics, multibody systems dynamics or granular materials).Other constitutive models are being developed to model plasticity, damage, cohesive zones. 

There are several ways of using Siconos:
1. As libraries integrated into your own modelling environment. The numerics and kernel components have been designed to be used independently and easily interfaced.
2. As an independent calculation code by writing C++ or python programs. (see example in tutorials )
3. Through our specialised modules such as mechanics, mechanisms or control. Examples of granular material modelling in Python interfaced with contact detection engines are available in mechanics (see example here). Examples of multi-body systems based on the B-Rep representation (CAD format using OpenCascade) are also possible with mechanisms in Python. 


Other applications are also targeted, as Siconos is designed to be a generic kernel simulator for non-smooth dynamical systems: a) switched electrical circuits, such as electrical circuits with ideal and piecewise linear components, b) sliding mode control systems, and c) biology (gene regulatory network).  Other applications can be found in systems and control (hybrid systems, optimal control with state control with state constraints), optimisation (complementarity systems and variational inequalities), fluid mechanics and computer graphics.
