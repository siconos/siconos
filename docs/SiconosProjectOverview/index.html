<h2>Mission and Scope</h2>
<h3>What is the purpose and scope of this document ?</h3>
<p>This document aims at presenting a general description of the
Siconos
platform project. It describes, in a very general way, the major
objectives
of the platform and the major constraints of development and
exploitation. It
is addressed to users and software framework builders.</p>
<h3>What is the scope of this project?</h3>
<p>This project belongs to the European project <a
 href="glossary.html#SICONOS">SICONOS</a>, dedicated to the modeling,
the
control the analysis and the simulation of the so-called ``Non Smooth
Dynamical system'' <a href="glossary.html#NSDS">NSDS</a>. More details
on
this European project can be found on the website of the Project <a
 href="http://siconos.inrialpes.fr">http://siconos.inrialpes.fr</a>.</p>
<p>The design and the development of the <a
 href="glossary.html#Siconos">Siconos</a> platform which is one of the
major
objective of this European project, is told the work package 2
("Numerical
methods and algorithms'') in confidence; More details on this European
project can be found on the website of the WP2 : <a
 href="http://siconos.inrialpes.fr/software">http://siconos.inrialpes.fr/software</a>.</p>
<h3>What are the main objectives and motivations ?</h3>
<dl>
  <dd>The first version of the objectives can be found in the Annex 1
of the proposition of the European Project.</dd>
</dl>
<dd>Besides the standard features which are required for a software of
scientific computing, the objectives of this project are of the
following :
  <ul>
    <li>To provide a common framework (modeling and simulation tools)
for non smooth problems present in various scientific fields : applied
Mathematics, Mechanics, Robotics, Electrical networks, etc.</li>
    <li>To be able to rely on existing developments, as well for the
modeling tools as for the simulation tools. The platform will not
re-implement the dedicated tools, which are already used for the
modeling of specific systems in various fields,but will provide a
framework to their integration. In the same way, we want to re-use
improved numerical low-level routines.</li>
    <li>To support exchanges and comparisons of methods between
researchers.</li>
    <li>To disseminate the know-how to other fields of research and
industry.</li>
    <li>To take into account the diversity of users (end users,
experts, software developers, framework builders,
industrial users, etc ... ).</li>
    <li>To set up standards in terms of modeling of the <a
 href="glossary.html#NSDS">NSDS.</a></li>
    <li>To ensure software quality by the use of modern software design
methods.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>
<h3>What is the exploitation context ?</h3>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#Siconos">Siconos</a> platform should be
used as
well by research academic teams as by the industries, interested in <a
 href="glossary.html#NSDS">NSDS.</a> As we said earlier, the platform
must
rely on existing habits of the community if users, that we want to
reach. The
exploitation must take into account these hard constraints.</p>
<p>To fulfill the constraints on the existing habits of a variety of
users,
the user interface must be implemented in three ways :</p>
<ul>
  <li>An expert and proper interface must be developed, allowing the
access of the maximum of the functionalities of the platform. A
accurate definition of an <a href="glossary-std.html#api">API</a> of
the platform based on all public method of the contained classes is
unavoidable. A interface to this <a href="glossary-std.html#api">API</a>
in a scripting (interpreted) language should be suitable.</li>
  <li>An <a href="glossary.html#xxxlab">xxxlab</a> interface, for
instance for <a href="glossary.html#Scilab">Scilab</a> (<a
 href="http://www.scilab.org">www.scilab.org</a> A free scientific
software package for numerical computations developed at <a
 href="glossary.html#INRIA">INRIA</a> too with the same
functionalities to <a href="glossary.html#Matlab">Matlab</a>)</li>
  <li>Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) embedded in a
integrated modeling and simulation environment.</li>
</ul>
To fulfill the constraints to re-use the existing development and
software,
the product must implement this two functionalities :
<ul>
  <li>To have a user plug-in interface to use in an easy way the code
which already model, non smooth dynamical. This users plug-in system
intend to provide to the user the possibility to input his data without
recompiling the platform</li>
  <li>To have a expert plug-in system, which allows us to specify the
behavior of a generic type of <a href="glossary.html#NSDS">NSDS</a>
in the platform by loading dynamically new types of derived systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>The project is currently under development, a first public version
will be
ready for October 2005</p>
