<h3>Source Code Organization and Build System Checklist</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Separation of files by type: Are files separated by type?</dt>
    <dd class="sample1">Yes. Except that application JSP and HTML files are
      in the same directory, which is convenient because sometimes we change
      an HTML file to be a JSP file.</dd>
  <dt>Separation of version-controlled and non-version controlled files: To
  what extent has this been achieved?</dt>
    <dd class="sample1">It has been achieved. Everything is under version
      control except for the "build" directory. No step in the build process
      should create or modify any file in any other directory.</dd>
  <dt>Compatibility with standard build processes: To what extent has this
  been achieved?</dt>
    <dd class="sample1">So far, so good. We can use build.xml files that are
      very close to the examples that come with Ant. One difference is that
      we keep our technical documentation under "www" rather than under
      "docs". Also, we have avoided the use of custom ant tasks.</dd>
  <dt>Platform independence: To what extent has this been achieved?</dt>
    <dd class="sample1">We are using Ant, which is itself platform
      independent. The names of the files and directories should work across
      platforms because they do not rely on case-sensitive names. We assume
      that the utility scripts in the "scripts" directory support all needed
      platforms and we have not created directories for different versions of
      these files aimed at specific platforms.</dd>
  <dt>Have these implementation decisions been communicated to the
  development team and other stakeholders?</dt>
    <dd class="sample1">Yes, everyone understands. Feedback is welcome.</dd>
    <dd class="sample1">No, this is a risk that is noted in the <a
      href="plan.html#risks">Risk Management</a> section.</dd>
