\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}


Software project management is 'the process of planning, organising, staffing, monitoring, controlling and leading a software project'. This part is based on the ESA ``guide to the  software project management'', PSS-05-08, \ac{esa} 1995. 

\subsection{Scope and Overview}

This part defines  the project management plan of the \acs{siconos} platform. In Section \ref{Sec:QP-PMP-PO}, the project organisation is defined. Major features of the technical process are defined in \ref{Sec:QP-PMP-TP}. Finally, in Section \ref{Sec:QP-PMP-WP}, a work breakdown structure, a schedule with  milestones and the roles and responsabilities are defined.

Actually, only the project management plan, and the technical process for \ac{kernel}  and \ac{numerics} is detailed.

For the more elaborate part of the platform, which are
\begin{itemize}
\item \ac{analysis}
\item \ac{control}
\item \ac{imse}
\end{itemize}
This work will be made later, based on the architecture and the development of the \ac{kernel}.

\section{Project Organisation}
\label{Sec:QP-PMP-PO}


\subsection{Organisational roles and responsibilities}




Due to the number of participants in the software project development, the organisation of the project is relatively simple. The Work Package 2 (Numerical Methods and Software development) is led by Vincent ACARY (C01), which is also the project manager of the software design and development. \\

The teams for the design and the development are defined as follows :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Team INRIA (C01):
  \begin{list}{-}{}
  \item Vincent Acary (VA) (Team Leader, designer, programmer)
  \item Roger Pissard--Gibollet (RPG) (Software quality leader)
  \item Jean--Baptiste Charlety (JBC) (programmer, test engineer , software librarian)
  \end{list}
\item  Team LMGC (AC2):
  \begin{list}{-}{}
  \item Frédéric Dubois (FD) (Team Leader, designer, programmer)
  \item Jean--Michel Barbier (JMB) (programmer, test engineer, software librarian)
  \item Shéherazade Nineb (SN) (programmer)
  \end{list}
\item Team ``Bristol'' (CR6),\hfill\ac{tbd} 
  \begin{list}{-}{}
  \item Petri Piiroinen (PP) (Team Leader, designer)
  \end{list}
\item Team "Control", \hfill  \ac{tbd} 
\item Team \acs{imse}, \hfill \ac{tbd} 
\end{enumerate}

The roles and responsabilities are roughly distributed in the table~\ref{Tab:Role1}. More details are given in the Section~\ref{Sec:Roles}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}[c]{|l|l|}
    \hline 
    Role & Teams \\
    \hline\hline
    \ac{numerics} & Team LMGC, Team INRIA \\
    \ac{kernel} & Team INRIA, Team LMGC\\
    \ac{analysis} & Team Bristol\\
    \ac{control} & Team Control \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Roles and responsabilities}
  \label{Tab:Role1}
\end{table}


\begin{ndr}
  Team Bristol and Team Control must be defined asap
\end{ndr}
\subsection{Organisational interfaces.}

The initiators of the project are the members of the Work Package 2.  The end users of the platform are the whole community of SICONOS, at least, for the first release. Then further distributions of the software will take into account the requirements of a wider scientific community, and then,  of the  industrial partners.

The interfaces between the Work Package 2 and the community of users is under the responsibility of the project manager.

\section{Technical process for the SICONOS/platform}
\label{Sec:QP-PMP-TP}


The section below focuses only  on the technical process for the \ac{numerics} and the \ac{kernel} of the platform.  It should be extended for the \ac{analysis}, \ac{control} and the \ac{imse}.

\subsection{Process model}

\subsubsection{Definitions of the phases of the design and  the development }

Following the ESA standards for small projects ESA-PSS050, the following phases of the design and  the development  are defined :
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The UR/SR phase}. The UR phase is the ``problem definition phase'' of a software project. The scope of the system must be defined. The user requirements must be captured. The SR phase is the ``analysis'' phase of a software project. A vital part of the analysis activity is the construction of a ``model'' describing \textit{what} the software has to do, and not \textit{how} to do it. Building prototypes to clarify the software requirements may be necessary. The principal deliverables of this phase are the User requirements Document (URD) and the Software Requirements document (SRD).
\item \textbf{The AD phase}.The purpose of the AD phase is to define the structure of the software. The model constructed in the SR phase is the starting point.This model is transformed into the architectural design by allocating functions to software components and defining the control and data flow between them.The deliverable item which constitutes the formal output of this phase is the Architectural Design Document (ADD).
\item \textbf{The DD Phase} The purpose of the DD phase is to detail the design of the software, and to code, document and test it. The Detailed Design Document (DDD) and  the Software User Manual (SUM) are produced concurrently with coding and testing.
\item \textbf{The TR Phase} The purpose of this phase is to establish that the software fulfils the requirements laid down in the SRD. This is done by installing the software and conducting acceptance tests.
\item  \textbf{The OM Phase} Once the software has entered into operation, it should be
  carefully monitored to confirm that it meets all the requirements defined in
  the SRD. Some of the requirements, for example those for availability,
  may take a period of time to validate. When the software has passed all
  the acceptance tests, it can be finally accepted. This is the OM Phase.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Project planning inputs and outputs}

The inputs to software project planning are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item User requirements \ac{urd}
\item \ac{srd}, \ac{esd}, \ac{add}, \ac{ddd} according to each phase
\item ESA  software standards for products and procedures;
\item time constraints, such as delivery dates;
\item resource constraints, such as the availability of staff;
\end{itemize}

% \begin{changebar}

The outputs to software project planning are:
\begin{itemize}
\item code
\item \ac{srd}, \ac{esd}, \ac{add}, \ac{ddd}, \ac{um}, \ac{std}
  according to each phase
\item \ac{qr}
\end{itemize}
% \end{changebar}


The Table \ref{Tab:IO-Products} summarises the software products of each phase as required by ESA PSS-05-0. 
The timetable for the output deliverables will be given in Section \ref{Sec:QP-PMP-WP}.

    \hline

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Phase input and output products}
  \label{Tab:IO-Products}
\end{table}
% \end{landscape}
% \end{changebar}

Because the developing staff is small, and in order to maintain the best consistency as possible in the documentation, the number of project documents is reduced in regard to \ac{esa} software engineering guides recommandations :
\begin{itemize}
\item The users Requirements are joined in a common document for all modules of the platform, the \ac{urd} 
\item Every project management, quality process data, and testing plans are joined in a common document (\ac{qpdoc}).
\item For \ac{numerics}, the SRD and ADD are joined in the \ac{ssd}. 
\end{itemize}

User requirements and software requirements are in \ac{srd}. 
Quality and testing reports are both in \ac{qr}. 

\subsubsection{Global life-cycle}

The  incremental delivery  approach, shown in Figure \ref{Fig:Icycle}, is characterised by splitting the DD, TR and OM phases into a number of more manageable units,
once the complete architectural design has been defined. The software is delivered in multiple releases, each with increased functionality and capability.
This may occurs when certain functions may need to be in place before others can be effective.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figure/incremental_life_cycle.eps}
  \caption{Software life-cycle and input/output documents according to each phase of development.} 
  \label{Fig:Icycle}
\end{figure}

During each increment, software requirements and architectural design documents are reviewed and may be lightly corrected. Detailed design, user manual and testing plans are completed as the work gradually progresses. \\

This life-cycle was chosen for this project because the kernel and basic functionnalities of the platform have to be validated before the development of specific plugins or of a smart interface. \\

\subsubsection{First increment : platform prototype}

This prototype was realised by four students in computer sciences during their final training course. From January to September 2004, they realized a complete increment 
cycle and they considered this first increment as a complete project development from user requirements elicitation to acceptance tests. To reach this objective, they used a standard software life-cycle approach illustrated on figure \ref{Fig:Vcycle}.

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figure/Vcycle.eps}
  \caption{Software Life-cycle and input/output documents according to each phase of development.}
  \label{Fig:Vcycle}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\subsubsection{Development continuation}

The development of the first version of the platform is planned in two others increment, as explained further in this document (see \ref{Subsec:Schedule}).




\subsection{Methods and Models}

\subsubsection{\ac{cocomo}}


This is a cost model for estimating the number of person-months required to develop software. The model also estimates the development schedule in months and produces an effort and schedule distribution by major phases. This model is based on Barry Boehm's ac{cocomo}\footnote{\texttt{http://www1.jsc.nasa.gov/bu2/COCOMO.html}}.Here is what Boehm says about the model: "Basic COCOMO is good for rough order of magnitude estimates of software costs, but its accuracy is necessarily limited because of its lack of factors to account for differences in hardware constraints, personnel quality and experience, use of modern tools and techniques, and other project attributes known to have a significant influence on costs." For more detailed information about \ac{cocomo} and software cost estimating in general, I strongly recommend reading Software Engineering Economics (1981), by Barry Boehm.

The model estimates cost using one of three different development modes: organic, semidetached and embedded. Here is a summary of how Boehm describes the modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Organic : In the organic mode, relatively small software teams develop software in a highly familiar, in-house environment. 
  Most people connected with the project have extensive experience in working with related systems within the organization, and have a thorough understanding of 
  how the system under development will contribute to the organizations objectives. Very few organic-mode projects have developed products with more than 50 thousand 
  delivered source instructions (KDSI). .
\item Semidetached: The semidetached mode of software development represents an intermediate stage between the organic and embedded modes. "Intermediate" may mean either of two things:
  an intermediate level of project characteristic or a mixture of the organic and embedded mode characteristics.The size range of a semidetached mode product generally 
  extends up to 300 KDSI.
\item Embedded : The major distinguishing factor of an embedded-mode software project is a need to operate within tight constraints. The product must operate within (is embedded in) a strongly coupled complex of hardware, software, regulations, and operational procedures, such as an electronic funds transfer system or an air traffic control system. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design method}
\label{Sec:ADD-DesignMethod}


\paragraph{\acs{sd} method.}
The \ac{sd} method is an extension to the \ac{sa} method. This method is based on the analysis of the data flow to get a first level architecture. Then this architecture is evaluated and restructured. This is performed in the seven steps of the method~:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fundamental diagram
\item Refinement of the data flow diagram
\item Determination of the kind of diagram
\item Plan of the frontier
\item First level architecture
\item Systematic building of the architecture
\item Evaluation and restructuring of the architecture
\end{enumerate}

With this method, one can evaluate the cohesion and the links between modules which is very important for the evolution of the software.
This method will help us to determine the global architecture.
In that way we will be able to design an architecture which will be progressive.
The architecture  must have low links between the different modules and have a high cohesion.

\paragraph{\ac{sd} diagram.}
The \ac{sd} diagram is a data flow diagram. It represents the input and output of informations. It also shows the functions, the data storages and the data flows.

% \paragraph{\acs{uml}}
% The \ac{uml} diagrams are numerous and can modelise lots of relations of the platform to define an adapted architecture to this platform. 

% =====
% UML
% Une architecture adaptée est la clé de voûte du succès d'un développement.
% Elle décrit des choix stratégiques qui déterminent en grande partie les qualités du logiciel (adaptabilité,
% performances, fiabilité...).
% =====


\subsubsection{Models}
\label{Sec:ADD-ModelTool}
To build a good architecture of the platform, we will use various modeling languages and tools. According to the type of information, we want to depict, the  appropriate model to formally represent data, functions, and behaviours of our system. Among them, we can cite the following diagrams :
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \ac{sd} diagram
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Data flow diagram\\
%     On this diagram, we represent the input and output of information. We also see the functions, the data storages and the data flows.
%   \end{itemize}



\paragraph{\acs{uml}}
The \ac{uml} diagrams are numerous and can modelise lots of relations of the platform to define an adapted architecture to this platform. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \acs{uml} diagrams.\\
  We will use \ac{uml} tools to create \ac{uml} diagrams.
  With \ac{uml}, we can modelise a big part of the architecture with the numerous \ac{uml} diagrams we will see further, and with \ac{ocl}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sequence diagram\\
    This diagram shows the links of the different actions we can find in the platform.
    It represents the interactions between the entities of the system.

  \item State diagram\\
    This diagram aims to represent automatons as state graphs. It shows the changes of state of an object or a
    module in response to the interactions.

    % ======
    % Ce diagramme sert à représenter des automates d'états finis, sous forme de graphes d'états, reliés par des arcs 
    % orientés qui décrivent les transitions.
    % Les diagrammes d'états-transitions permettent de décrire les changements d'états d'un objet ou d'un composant,
    % en réponse aux interactions avec d'autres objets/composants ou avec des acteurs.
    % Un état se caractérise par sa durée et sa stabilité, il représente une conjonction instantanée des valeurs des
    % attributs d'un objet.
    % Une transition représente le passage instantané d'un état vers un autre.
    % ======

  \item Collaboration diagram\\
    This diagram shows the interactions between the objects (instances of classes and actors). It allows to represent
    the context of an interaction.

    % ====
    % Les diagrammes de collaboration montrent des interactions entre objets (instances de classes et acteurs).
    % Ils permettent de représenter le contexte d'une interaction, car on peut y préciser les états des objets qui 
    % interagissent.
    % ====

  \item Classes diagram\\
    These diagram are collections of classes which show the structure of a model. We use several diagrams for complex models.

    % ====
    % Un diagramme de classes est une collection d'éléments de modélisation statiques (classes, paquetages...), qui 
    % montre la structure d'un modèle.
    % Un diagramme de classes fait abstraction des aspects dynamiques et temporels.  
    % Pour un modèle complexe, plusieurs diagrammes de classes complémentaires doivent être construits.
    % ====
  \end{itemize}


\item \acs{ocl}\\
  \ac{ocl} is a declarative language for describing rules that apply to UML models developed at IBM and now part of the UML standard.\\
  A formal specification language extension to UML. The Object Constraint Language is a precise text language that provides constraint and object query expressions on an object-oriented model that cannot otherwise be expressed by diagrammatic notation.\\
  OCL supplements UML by providing expressions that have neither the ambiguities of natural language nor the inherent difficulty of using complex mathematics.\\


\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Format, style and tools for documentation}
All formats, styles and tools for documentation are defined in the \ac{cds}

\subsubsection{Coding standards}


The Coding standards are defined in the \ac{cds}. These standards
will be respected with the help of the Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) Eclipse.

\subsection{Description of the major work packages}

\
In the section above, six  work package has been defined. This first work package, ``\textsf{1000 Software Project Management}'' to the general management of the project. The last three packages are not yet defined in details.



We will   described, in the following  section, the two major work package which are ``\textsf{2000 Siconos/Numerics Software Production}'' and  ``\textsf{3000 Platform kernel Siconos/Engine Siconos/Front-End Software Production }''.

% For each work package, describe the inputs, tasks, outputs, effort requirements, resources allocated and verification process.





\subsubsection{\textsf{2000 Siconos/Numerics Software Production}}



According to the numbering convention of the functionalities in the \ac{srd}, the increments of software production must contain :
\textsf{\begin{itemize}
  \item[2310] First Increment Production\\
    Linear algebra pack : F.1.001; F.1.003.1; F.1.003.2; F.1.010.1;  \\
    MPSolver Pack :  F.1.011.1; F.1.011.2; F.1.011.3; F.1.011.4\\
    C++ interface : F.1.020
  \item[2320] Second Increment Production\\
    ODE Pack : F.1.012;  F.1.013;  F.1.014;\\
    Root finding : F.1.013 \\
    Automatic, analytical and numerical differentiation : F.1.014 \\
    SciLab interface : F.1.020 \\
  \item[2330] Third Increment Production\\
    Linear algebra pack optimisation : F.1.002\\
    Matrices storage methods : F.1.003.4 \\
  \end{itemize}}

This work package is realized by the SICONOS/Numerics defined in the Section \ref{Sec:QP-PMP-PO}. Only S. Nineb, which is a PhD Student hired by the project will work full time for 6 months on this development.  With the other participants, the total resources for this work package may be estimated around 10 man.month. These resources are only sufficient for the design and the development of the first increment. For others increments, it must be planned to hire an other person. 

\subsubsection{\textsf{3000 Platform kernel Siconos/Engine Siconos/Front-End Software Production}}

According to the numbering convention of the functionalities in the \ac{srd}, the increments of software production must contain :
\textsf{  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[3310] First Increment Production\\    
    API C++ : F.2.000--F.2.002; PER.00 \\
    XML storage files :  F.2.200; F.2.301;    F.2.302;   F.2.304;   DAT.00; F.3.000; INT.00; INT.01;\\
    Basic Plug-in : F.2.042; \\
    Model Formalization : F.2.015; F.2.024; F.2.027; \\
    Numerical strategy : F.2.100;   F.2.102--F.2.105; \\
    Output and Trace values : F.2.303;
  \item[3320] Second Increment Production\\
    API C : F.3.001; \\ 
    Interface between the API C and Scilab \ac{tbd} \\
    Interface between the API C++ and Python \ac{tbd} \\
    Model Formalization  : F.3.001; \\ 
    Numerical strategy : F.2.101; \\
    LMGC90 Plug-in :   F.2.045;
  \item[3330] Third Increment Production\\
    The rest of  functionalities.\ac{tbd}
  \end{itemize}
}

% This work package is the core of the platform. It is realized by Frédéric Dubois, Vincent Acary and four students in software engineering which are hired  for 6 month. The total resources  for this work package is  around 36 man.month. This will be sufficient to carry out the first and the second increments. To carry out the third increment, it is planned to hire a software engineer for the year 2005.
