* `Modelica <http://www.modelica.org/>`_, Modeling of Complex Physical Systems. The object-oriented modeling
language Modelica is designed to allow convenient, component-oriented modeling of complex physical systems, e.g., systems
containing mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.
The free Modelica language, free Modelica libraries and Modelica simulation tools are available, ready-to-use and have been utilized in demanding industrial
applications, including hardware-in-the-loop simulations. The development and promotion of Modelica is organized by the non-profit Modelica Association.

* `OOfelie <http://venus.arcride.edu.ar/oofelie.html>`_ Object Oriented Finite Elements Led by Interactive Execution. This project is the result of a collaboration between the Computational Mechanics Group of INTEC and the Laboratoire de Techniques AÃ©ronautiques et Spatiales, University of Liege, Belgium. The objective of this work is to define the architecture of a new finite element program using the C++ programming language. The program is built around an interpreter, which allows the user to define interactively either data as well as algorithms. The program may thus be very easily configured to new computational strategies. See also `the non official site <http://garfield.ltas.ulg.ac.be/oo_meta/fr_oometa.htm>`_.
