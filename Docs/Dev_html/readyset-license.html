 <h2>License FAQ</h2>

 <dl>
  <dt>Can I use these templates at my company?</dt>

  <dd>Yes, absolutely.  Once you fill in the template with detailed
  information about a specific project, you are free to do what you
  want with them in the context of that project.  You may even hide
  the template copyright statement: the best way to do that is to edit
  the file inst.css.</dd>


  <dt>Can I modify these templates for use on several projects at my
  company?</dt>

  <dd>Yes, absolutely.  You may modify and distribute these templates
  to others, so long as you retain this file and the footnote with the
  copyright statement clearly visible in each file.</dd>


  <dt>Can I include these templates as part of a commercial
  product?</dt>

  <dd>If you use the templates and fill in details about a given
  product, go ahead.  If you are thinking of making a product that
  includes the templates for use <i>as templates</i>, you must retain
  this file and the copyright statement in a visible footnote.  An
  enhanced commercial version of these templates, <a
  href="http://www.readysetpro.com/">ReadySET Pro</a>, is already in
  development</dd>


  <dt>Can I combine these templates with other templates or
  documents?</dt>

  <dd>Sure, go ahead.  This license is not "viral", it does not mean
  that anything you do must be open source or covered under the same
  license.</dd>


  <dt>If I enhance the templates, must I give those enhancements back
  to the open source project?</dt>

  <dd>No, but it would be very welcome.  Even if you don't modify the
  templates, you can share your "words of wisdom".  For more
  information on contributing, see the <a
  href="http://readyset.tigris.org/">ReadySET home page</a>.</dd>

  <dt>ReadySET seems too good to be true.  What is the catch?  Why
  would anyone buy a commercial version?</dt>

  <dd>There is no catch.  However, the scope of ReadySET is limited to
  only most common needs of development projects.  It is easy to get
  started with ReadySET, but <a
  href="http://www.readysetpro.com/">ReadySET Pro</a> holds much more
  value for corporate users.</dd>
